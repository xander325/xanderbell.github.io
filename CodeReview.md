<p>First things first, we must understand the existing functionalities of this program. Using the eclipse IDE, we are using the java language to develop a program that creates and/or updates an appointment. We have the following files, Appointment.java, appointmenttest.java and we have appointmentserivce.java and appointmentserviceTest.java.
These files and their matching test files work in conjunction to not only create a program but also test the functionalities of a program.</p>
<div class="row">
	<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
		<h3>Code Analysis</h3>
		<p>The structure of these files show that code is implemented correctly and conforms to pertinent standards, as we can see through indentations, clear to read, doesn’t have identifiers used for multiple purposes and so on.
This structure is consistent across all four of our files here and there are no uncalled-for procedures and/or unreachable code implemented in our design.
When taking a look at our test files, there is not any leftover test routines or anything along those lines; our tests here are designed to test the functionalities of our code, nothing more and nothing less!
The way I designed this code and the way all code should be designed is in a modular fashion. Having the ability to replace sections and/or copy sections of this project and implement it into another is important. It is clear that we can do that with the code we have here; a good example of this is the setup portion for the test files, this is a very modular section and because of this, we are able to take this same setup structure and implement it elsewhere if need be.
I think the code I have here is about as concise as it can be, I believe if it were any more concise it would be hard to read and not nearly as modular as it currently is; it is also about as efficient as it can be to my knowledge.
We can also see in appointment.java and appointmentserivce.java, we use symbolics for constants and string constants, all our “final private byte” variables and the “final private List”  are examples of symbolic constants.

	<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
		<h3>Enhancements</h3>
		<p>In terms of enhancements, I have tried to analyze enough to highlight any areas of improvement but nothing is excessively complex in my opinion, I think the current structure checks out. 
I plan to add to this further by adding the ability to input customer information like name and DOB. I will then design automated tests to ensure the functionality of these enhancement to show competency in the 1st, 2nd and 5th required outcomes of this course by demonstrating innovative techniques and coherent code, which inevitably promotes a collaborative environment.</p>
