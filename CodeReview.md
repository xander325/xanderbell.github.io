<p>Below is the code review of my CS499 Capstone artifacts, these artifacts encompass three different categories: Software Engineering & Design, Algorithms & Data structures, and Databases. Code reviews are extremely important because the additional perspectives obtained through code reviews allow us to not only receive a better grasp of our work but also expose us to different insights that we may not have been aware of prior. These different insights may lead to finding syntax issues and/or inefficiencies or redundancies that can be eliminated. Reviewing our own work out-loud give a similar effect; This is exactly that.</p>
