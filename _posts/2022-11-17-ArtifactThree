This program utilizes a CSV file and imports it into a hash table for our program to search through and remove items from the desired database and we have a dashboard of users to utilize. This assignment was from DAT220, it was broken when  I initially pulled it from my files. 

The goal of this artifact is to showcase databases and my competency with them. In efforts to reach our course outcomes; demonstrating an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques and demonstrating a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits, designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, and mitigate design flaws, I felt this program was most applicable. The enhancements I have made here have revealed my abilities with software development as I have not only fixed the program and got it running from its original state but I have also implemented a fail-safe for the remove function, confirming with the user before removing a file.

Unfortunately, my initial plan to create a filter for the database didnâ€™t work as well as a wanted with a hash table so instead, I decided it would be best to remain using hash tables and take a different approach to my enhancements. Ultimately, I was able to meet those same desired outcomes with the approach of implementing a user inputted a bid id search and a user inputted removal of record via  bid ID.

It took me a quite a while to get the program to work properly and read a CSV file initially, I spent a ton of time fiddling with things over the past two days, Once I was able to get the program to build successfully and output the desired code, I felt I was finally getting somewhere. Then, I began playing around with different database techniques like a binary tree vs a hash tables. Untimely, I stuck to a hash table and changed my planned enhancements instead. I feel like the route I ended up going with worked best and technically, I made more enhancements than I would have with my original plan. It was helpful to circle back and work with databases and it was a nice refresher!


Professor comments:
The enhancement is fitting for the category. I am concerned about your professional communication as there is a pattern of errors. You will need a lot of proofing and polish before the portfolio submission. Please visit the writing center for help so your skills are the focus.

(Example: Untimely, I stuck to a hash table and changed my planned enhancements instead. )

Make sure your file has clear headers and addresses the intent and decisions made in the file....a You need to clearly highlight the before and after.  Your narrative should also be updated to reflect this as well. 

This is an all or none score, and you have met the criteria for this instance of the milestone. For the final portfolio clean up a bit more and make sure you comment a bit more with intent and decision for the overall functionality of each file in the header as well as inline so any programmer can hop in and edit. You talk about how you that met outcomes so now be really specific with your enhancements and how they align.  Solid work and with a few small updates, you are ready.
