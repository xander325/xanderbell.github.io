<p>In this artifact, we have five Java files that all work in conjunction to run our main file, VM.java and this file utilizes a text file of virtual addresses and converts it to its physical addresses and values to ultimately simulate the algorithms and data structures an operating system go through.

This specific artifact showcases the complexity of data structures and algorithms; Because this focuses on how an operating system goes about converting virtual memory to physical memory, I saw an opportunity to add a tool for analyzation purposes, a runtime counter. With my improvements, we can see how long each conversion takes for the computer to process, in nanoseconds. This really puts into perspective the speed and efficiencies of a computer when dealing with different algorithms and data structures.

I feel as though I really did well with the enhancements here; Albeit, my enhancements were small, I believe they made sense and they truly make this artifact much more useful. I know initially when I set the goal for this I was a bit intimidated but it turned out well and I am really happy with no only the simplicity of my addition but the usability of it!

This code was something we were provided in IT-165 and made very small edits too if my memory severs me right. We may have not done anything and just ran it as is to get an idea how a computer converts virtual memory to physical memory. So, with that being said getting it to run correctly was tedious but once I began playing around with enhancements, I was able to figure it out pretty quickly!

Professor comments: For the final portfolio clean up more and make sure you comment a bit more with intent and decision for the overall functionality of each Java file in the header as well as inline so any programmer can hop in and edit. You talk about that you met outcomes, but you have to identify and then articulate which outcomes of the five and how you met one or more of those with each category enhancement. Sound work and with a few small updates, you are ready. </p>

		<h3>Code Analysis</h3>

		<p>For category two, Algorithms and data structures we have more Java files that work in conjunction to simulate an operating system utilizing algorithms and data structures to manage all it's components. More specifically, the focus here is about Windows OS and how it goes about managing processes, memory, files, and system resources through algorithms and data structures. This uses six Java files: PageTableEntry, TLBEntry, VM, MakeBACKING_STORE, Frame, and Address. These 6 files allow the user to input a given page size and virtual address and calculate the page number and offset. This is done through algorithms and data structures.</p>

		<h3>Output Analysis</h3>
<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)"><span class="image fit"><img src="assets/images/ART2test1.JPG" alt="" /></span></div>
		<p>While this code may be a little hard to follow at first glace, we can clearly see what is what when following the comments provided; Here we can see what section of the code is doing what and it is very consistent with the code itself. When analyzing the variables here, we can see that all of these variables we are working with, FRAME_Size, or ADDRESS_SIZE are all very self explanatory; Naming is consistent and clear. We can also see that the consistency between the type of variables and the casting of these variables. It is also clear that we do not have any redundant or unused variables; All the of the code we have here is necessary. In terms of arithmetic operations, we can see that this code does indeed avoid comparing floats; It does not utilize floats. Because of this structure, we do not have to worry about the possibility of rounding errors. Considering this code specifically focuses on the translation of virtual memory, we are really only working with a specific set of numbers.</p>

		<h3>Enhancements</h3>
		<p> I have made enhancements to the two files that allow us to create and edit these appointments. The enhancements I have implemented allowed me to add extra fields for our appointment service, adding further capabilities. Being able to demonstrate well-founded and innovated techniques like junit testing and proper Java langauge uasge.</p>
