My time attending SNHU and working towards a Bachelors of Computer Science has taught me a lot; From understanding the basics of physical hardware, learning different programming langauges, and getting outside of my comfort zone with writing actual code all while working 40 hours a week in lab surrounded by even more computers has all  been a lot. Although, that is not to say I haven't enjoyed every step along the way because, I truly have. Comparing myself to where I was when I first attended SNHU four years ago, I have become far more comfortable with physical hardware, networking, and software development that I would have ever anticipated. My goal has always been to be as well rounded as possible and while I may focus on hardware debug, micro-soldering, networking setup, and server maintence at work 40 hours a week; Being able to similtanously focus on school, the other spectrum of computers like software development and design, databases, data structures and algorithms has defintely set me apart. This ePorfolio encapsalates the all those fundamentals I have learned here at SNHU.
