My time attending SNHU and working towards a Bachelor of Computer Science degree has taught me a lot; From understanding the basics of physical hardware, learning different programming languages, and getting outside of my comfort zone with writing actual code all while working 40 hours a week in lab surrounded by even more computers has all been a lot. Although, that is not to say I havenâ€™t enjoyed every step along the way because, I truly have. Comparing myself to where I was when I first attended SNHU four years ago, I have become far more comfortable with physical hardware, networking, and software development that I would have ever anticipated. My goal has always been to be as well rounded as possible and while I may focus on hardware debug, micro-soldering, networking setup, and server maintenance at work 40 hours a week; Being able to simultaneously focus on school and the other spectrum of computers like; Software development and design, databases, data structures and algorithms has indeed set me apart. This ePorfolio encapsulates all the fundamentals I have learned here at SNHU; From employing strategies to build collaborative environments by maintaining modularity, creating coherent communications by tracking and noting changes to utilizing algorithms and databases while managing the trade-offs involved with design choice. By also thinking as an adversary I have been able to maintain a security mindset and implement these innovative techniques. These are all fundamentals that I have had the luxury of practicing and perfecting here at SNHU; The following artifacts will showcase these fundamentals.
