My time attending SNHU and working towards a Bachelor of Computer Science has taught me a lot; From understanding the basics of physical hardware, learning different programming languages, and getting outside of my comfort zone with writing actual code all while working 40 hours a week in lab surrounded by even more computers has all been a lot. Although, that is not to say I haven't enjoyed every step along the way because, I truly have. Comparing myself to where I was when I first attended SNHU four years ago, I have become far more comfortable with physical hardware, networking, and software development that I would have ever anticipated. My goal has always been to be as well rounded as possible and while I may focus on hardware debug, micro-soldering, networking setup, and server maintenance at work 40 hours a week; Being able to simultaneously focus on school, the other spectrum of computers like software development and design, databases, data structures and algorithms has indeed set me apart. This ePorfolio encapsulates all the fundamentals I have learned here at SNHU. From employing strategies to build collaborative environments, creating coherent communications, utilizing algorithms and databases while managing the trade-offs involved with design choice, implementing innovative techniques, and maintaining a security mindset are skills that I have had the luxury of practicing and perfecting here at SNHU; The following artifacts will showcase these fundamentals.
